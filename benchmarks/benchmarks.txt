The dhrystone benchmarks were benchmarked with the find_primes executable
in the test_data/test_exec folder. The parameters passed to it are:
15000000 8
where the program will find the prime numbers up until 15000000 with 8
threads (programmed with OpenMP). These numbers give a 
sufficient amount of time for the program to run while the benchmark runs. 

The whetstone benchmarks were benchmarked with the find_primes executable as
well, but the parameters passed to it are:
17000000 8
