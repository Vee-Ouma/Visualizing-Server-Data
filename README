This project visualizes CPU, RAM, and SSD power data on a website using Django, Highcharts, and MongoDB. 

This software was developed using Ubuntu 10.10.
To use this software,

1. Install mongodb, pymongo, and memcached
    sudo apt-get install mongodb, python-pymongo, memcached, python-setuptools
    sudo easy_install python-memcached

2. Create the data directory for mongodb:
    sudo mkdir /data
    sudo mkdir /data/db

3. Install Django by going to their website:
    http://www.djangoproject.com/download/
    or
    sudo apt-get install python-django

    Also, install paramiko for sshing to other servers:
    sudo apt-get install python-paramiko

    Fill in passwords for ssh connections in account_info.py (Not in the
    project currently for privacy reasons).
    username and password are for the ssh connection
    The next part of the account_info is for setting up the email for
    approving users to the site. Please fill out the information.

4. Start the mongodb server on a port. The following using port 90:
    sudo mongod --port 90

    and start memcached:
    sudo memcached -d -u www-data -p 11211 -m 64

    (-d is daemon mode, -u is the user, -p is the port, and -max amount of
    memory used)

5. To load test data into Mongodb taken from our Atom servers,
    run test_data/parse_server_output.py with output_shorter.daq2 as input:

    python parse_server_output.py < output_shorter.daq2

6. DAQ instructions (if you plan on using the daq instead of the test_input):
    Navigate to cmd directory and edit the ABS_PATH in 
    cmd/config.h and compile with:
    
    gcc daq.c -lcomedi -lm -lpthread -o daq

7. To start Django, in Server_data_visualization run:
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py runserver 0:8000

8. To see the website, type

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload/

    into a web browser and enjoy.

Troubleshooting Notes:

Be sure that the database file created by django is owned by apache:
chown www-data database
