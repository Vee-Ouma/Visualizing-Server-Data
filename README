This project visualizes CPU, RAM, and SSD power data on a website using Django, Highcharts, and MongoDB. 

This software was developed using Ubuntu 10.10.
To use this software,

1. Install mongodb:
    sudo apt-get install mongodb

2. Install Django by going to their website:
    http://www.djangoproject.com/download/
    or
    sudo apt-get install python-django

3. To load test data into Mongodb taken from our Atom servers,
    run test_data/parse_server_output.py with output_shorter.daq2 as input:

    python parse_server_output.py < output_shorter.daq2

4. Start the mongodb server on a port. The following using port 90:
    sudo mongod --port 90

5. Unfortunately, the Django developers have taken a pretty firm stance
    against relative paths:
      http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/694

    Therefore, before starting the Django server, edit
    Server_data_visualization/settings.py with the absolute paths that
    correspond to your configuration. 
    The absolute paths appear in:
      1. the NAME field of the DATABASES dictionary
      2. TEMPLATE_DIRS
      3. STATIC_DOC_ROOT

6. To start Django, in Server_data_visualization run:
    python manage.py runserver

7. To see the website, type

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/power/

    into a web browser and enjoy.
